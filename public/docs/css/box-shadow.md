The [`box-shadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) property can have multiple properties with the following rules:

```
shadow-box: none;
shadow-box: <offset-x> <offset-y> [blur-radius] [spread-radius] ['inset'] [color]
```

Notes:

- inset and color can be used at the start, end or either end of the definition, but not in the middle.
